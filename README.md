# Integra

A multi-agent system for integrating open-source solutions into Pydantic AI projects.

## Overview

Integra helps users integrate existing open-source solutions (agents, MCP servers, or APIs) into their Pydantic AI projects. It operates using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in AI IDEs like Cursor, providing intelligent search, evaluation, and integration assistance.

## Features

- Discovers relevant open-source solutions for your Pydantic AI projects
- Evaluates solution compatibility and integration requirements
- Processes and synthesizes documentation
- Generates step-by-step integration instructions
- Uses Google Gemini 2.0 Flash model for consistent performance

## Architecture

Integra consists of five specialized agents:

1. Coordinator Agent - Orchestrates workflow and interfaces with Cursor
2. Search Agent - Discovers relevant open source solutions
3. Evaluation Agent - Assesses solution viability for projects
4. Documentation Agent - Retrieves and processes documentation
5. Integration Agent - Creates step-by-step integration instructions

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
